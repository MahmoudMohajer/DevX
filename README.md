# DevX

System of AI developer Agents which work and communicate together to develop the given project. The DevX takes project name and its requirements as input and Gives you back the complete project code. The Agents with different rules have different abilities, and they are experts in their own field. The General idea is to create an autonomous team of AI developers. They will utelize LLMs to generate and edit code. 

## Features

- **Autonomous Project Development**: DevX takes project requirements as input and autonomously generates the complete project code.
  
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has a specific role (e.g., frontend, backend, testing) and expertise in its domain.

- **Collaborative AI Agents**: Agents communicate and work together to solve complex problems and ensure coherence in the project.

- **LLM-Powered Code Generation**: Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating, editing, and optimizing code.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Agents can revise code based on feedback or evolving requirements, ensuring adaptability.

- **Modular Structure**: Easy to extend with additional agents or skills to handle new types of tasks or programming languages.

- **Version Control Integration**: Automatically integrates with Git for tracking changes and collaboration.

- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Agents can identify, debug, and fix issues during the development cycle.
